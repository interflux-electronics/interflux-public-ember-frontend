      <h2>A true pioneer</h2>
      <p>Interflux® Electronics N.V. has always been in the forefront when it
        comes to innovative development of soldering chemistry.
        <strong>IF2005M</strong>, the first of its kind body-free,
        <strong>No-residue&trade;</strong>
        flux was conceived, produced and made successful by the Interflux®
        Group. Furthermore, Interflux was one of the first to offer a high
        performance, high quality completely VOC-free line of soldering fluxes:
        the
        <strong>PacIFic series</strong>. With
        <strong>IF 14</strong>, Interflux introduced a solder wire chemistry
        with brushable residues, a property that is still unique today.</p>
